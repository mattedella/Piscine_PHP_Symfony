# PHP & Symfony Learning Projects

This repository contains a series of progressively more advanced exercises and mini-projects created to learn and practice web development using **PHP** and the **Symfony framework**.

üß† The projects begin with **legacy Symfony 2.8 and PHP 5.6**, and gradually evolve into modern **Symfony 6.4 with PHP 8.3**, covering a wide range of concepts in both versions.

Depending on the exercise:

- PHP 5.6 (for Symfony 2.8 projects)
